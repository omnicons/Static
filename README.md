# Static
Version 3 of the Static IRC bot hosted for BronyTV written in C++
# Installation
It's as simple as going in the directory and building it as long as you have the build-essential package installed

     cd Static/
  
    ./Makefile
# Configuration
This bit is subject to change as how we're handing configuration right now is simple, but more functionality will be added later.

Current options are:

* irc_host (Currently only supports IPv4 hosts)

* irc_port (Currently only supports non ssl ports)
